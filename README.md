# Erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism affects muscle oxygenation and exercise performance: a randomized double-blind crossover study in humans

This repository corresponds to our paper titled "**Erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism affects muscle oxygenation and exercise performance: a randomized double-blind crossover study in humans**", which is under preparation. Here, we investigated the role of erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism in exercise fatigue using a combination of *in vivo*, *in vitro* and quantitative approaches.
