# The role of erythrocyte metabolism in muscle oxygenation and exercise performance

This repository corresponds to our paper titled "**Investigating the role of erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism in muscle oxygenation and exercise performance**", which is under preparation. Here, we investigated the role of erythrocyte metabolism in performance using a combination of *in vivo*, *in vitro* and quantitative approaches.
